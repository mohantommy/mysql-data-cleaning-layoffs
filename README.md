# MySQL Data Cleaning Project – Layoffs Dataset

This project demonstrates **data cleaning in SQL (MySQL)** on a layoffs dataset.

## Steps performed:
1. Removed duplicates using `ROW_NUMBER()`.
2. Standardized text fields (`TRIM()`, fixing inconsistent names).
3. Converted date strings into proper `DATE` format.
4. Handled NULL and blank values (filled missing industries).
5. Dropped helper columns used in cleaning.

## Why this project?
Data cleaning is an essential skill in Data Analytics, ML, and Software Engineering.  
This project shows my ability to prepare messy, real-world datasets for analysis using SQL.

## Tools
- MySQL 8.0
- MySQL Workbench
- GitHub for version control

## Files
- `layoffs_data_cleaning.sql` – full SQL cleaning script
